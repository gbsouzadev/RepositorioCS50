#### Description:

Kabbalah is a web application specifically developed to make life easier for Kabbalistic numerologists.
<br /> 
Kabbalistic numerologists use a mathematical system, based on the principle that each letter of the alphabet has a specific numeral value, and from various ways of combining these values, accompanied by the date of birth, it is possible to infer hidden meanings related to traits of personality, trends, challenges, propensities, blocks and many other aspects of a person's life or even a brand or company, being, therefore, a pseudoscience.
<br /> <br /> 
In Kabbalistic numerology, only the digits from 1 to 9 are considered, so that if the result of a certain combination of values ​​is different from these digits, it is necessary to carry out what is called “theosophical reduction”. For example, if a certain calculation results in the number 25, it will be necessary to add 2 + 5, to only then obtain the final result: 7. There are exceptions to this rule, related to the search for some specific values, where they can be considered as final result the number 11 and the number 22.
<br /> <br /> 
In this sense, Kabbalah is an application that analyzes the name and date of birth informed by the user and, from this data, the application delivers all the results necessary for the interpretation of the Kabbalistic numerologist to determine the hidden meanings that make up the name informed.
<br /> <br /> 
Using this application guarantees Kabbalistic numerologists 2 (two) advantages, which consist of:
<br /> <br /> 
       1. Time saving, behold, a professional spends, on average, 2 (two) hours to perform all the calculations necessary for the numerological interpretation of a name, including the assembly of the so-called “basic triangle of life”;
<br /> <br /> 
       2. Infallible assertiveness of the values ​​calculated from the information provided by the user, since the professional will no longer be subject to possible human errors when performing the various calculations involved, even when using a calculator for that purpose.
<br /> <br /> 
The application itself consists of using the microframework Flask, in which its back-end and all the algorithms were developed in python. The user can leave a message and their contact information for the administrator. To access the calculation area, the user must register and be effectively logged in.
